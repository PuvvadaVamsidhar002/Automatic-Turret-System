# Automatic-Turret-System
Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Project

All the files in this repository are based on the Matlab and also the .ipynb file is a part of our project which is an initial part of identifying the Jets from the video and identify the distance to the jet.
There are figures images for every trajectory we have experimented with and also there are images with high noise which replicates real time scenarios and also low noise which is an ideal simulation case.
